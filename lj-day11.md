# LJ Code 301 - Day 11

Learned a lot this week, really catching up.

So I understand pg express and body-parser more and have taken good notes on them in the assignments.  This has to do with the server, and our/user/our codes interaction with the VIEW, MODEL, CONTROLLER.

On top of this we just learned about page(), and this is how the href know's what to do with the dom... it routes everything through our CONTROLLER process in our VMC.
