# LJ Code 301 - Day 10

Learned a lot the last weekend + more...
So i learned a ton about new code to use and how to refactor code.  We learned the shortcut function arrow syntax => which makes our code shorter.  

Also I learned a few new function like .map(), .split(), .reduce(), which all work well to manipulate or negotiate with elements inside our arrays. :)
