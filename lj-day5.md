# LJ Code 301 - Day 5

Learning Journal for day five... I'm going to include my weekend in this journal because I have made major progress from the weekend.  With the help from friends in class I feel more comfortable with this class.  

MyPortfolio assignment is behind, but now it is not behind by much and doesn't feel like a huge weight, I believe that I will catch up soon with this assignment and I am picking up more and more of the code.

Things I've learned:  Really picking up reading the code... Reading JQuery is becoming easier, and this leaves me to believe that I'll be writing at a more advanced level soon.  Reminds me of the progression in 201.  

I'm finally much more aquainted with the Hamburger Menu, but still need to learn more about the implementation of the function to activate it. I have incorporated many show and hide functions into my portfolio that allow my to reveal my content and hide it when needed. Some templating has been implemented into my portfolio, although I'm not happy with that portion yet.
