# LJ Code 301 - Day 3

Okay, so I've learned so much in the last 3 days.  Total recap === Right now I'm nearly caught up to my understanding of where to focus and how to keep up with this class.  I'm behind in the personal portfolio project, but I'll be able to catch up on that assignment process soon.  There really is not enough time in class to get all this done I feel like :) but in complete contradiction, I know I can do it.  I'll have to utilize my weekends effectively.  

JQUERY:  Learning!  Getting through problems and picking up the syntax now.  People in the class have been very helpful with this and I'm coming out feeling like this class will be a good learning experience for me and that I'll be successful.  

As of right now I have a good grasp of how to read the jquery and how to use event handlers and other methods.  Still have to use the docs and previously written code frequently to be able to do this, but that's a consistent part of coding from my understanding.
