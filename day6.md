# LJ Code 301 - Day 3

So many of my notes are in this file for DAY 6... I know open up a JS file and HTML file for every day to track all the notes and keep up as best I can with the class.

I think that'll actually be caught up with the class by the end of the day, and actually believe that I may be able to provide some value to the rest of the class and help them out with some things.

I really like Handlebars.js stuff now that I understand how to manipulate it better.  Furthermore, I'm getting exponentially better at reading the code, and I know after looking at more and more code I'm going to be writing this fluently soon!  STILL behind in the class, I'm behind by one lab, but I'm going to clean all that up tonight.
