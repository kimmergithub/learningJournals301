# LJ Code 301 - Day 1

This class just jumped right back into it.  One day in and I already feel behind.  As far as the class content is concerned, I don't think that's the important stuff for this learning experience in the journal.  Most important notes are an increase awareness of time management, a completely different set of requirements for turning in assignments, and a schedule adjustment that needs to be made for the odd class hours.
