# LJ Code 301 - Day 8

Learning so much!  Today what I really picked up on and reflected upon was the communication between our computers, the server, and the DOM.   
So, to be specific === here's my understanding of how NODE, Express, and Nodemon work.  Node is the door that opens up communication lines between us and the server.  Express is the language that allows us to be able to communicate with the server, and the Nodemon is an application that makes the server integrate the commands given by express and allows for interaction on the DOM... or should I say, watches over the whole cycle of interaction from request to response.
